# WiFi-Study
A study of the quality of the WiFi and user perceptions of the WiFi conducted by students.

There are two datasets in this repository.

The first is WiFiStudy. This dataset consists of various measurements of the WiFi network taken by students. The variables are,

- **Date** = The date that the measurement was taken.
- **Time** = The time of day when the measurement was taken.
- **Device** = The device/operating system used to take the measurement.
- **Location** = The location where the measurement was taken.
- **SpeedDownload** = The download speed measured in mbps.
- **SpeedUpload** = The upload speed measured in mbps.
- **StrengthStrongest** = The signal strength of the strongest wifi connection available measured in dbm.
- **NumberofAvailableNetworks** = The number of visible available networks.
- **NumberOfDevices** = The number of devices connected to the strongest network available. 



The second is WiFiSurvey. This dataset consists of survey responses. The survey was designed by students to measure student perception of the quality of the WiFi. The variables are,

- **Dorm** = “What dorm are you in?”	
- **Quality** = “How would you rate the overall quality of the Wi-Fi?”
- **HotspotFrequency** = “How often do you use cellular data hotspots?”
- **HotspotUse** = “Do you use hotspots for the sole purpose of connecting devices that cannot connect to the wifi?”
- **Problem** = “Which problem is bigger?”
- **TechCenter** = “Have you ever went to the tech center to fix your Wi-Fi connection?”
- **Inhibit** = “How often does a problem with the wifi actively inhibit your work?”
- **DataPlan** = “Can your cellular data plan support the substantial usage of a hotspot?”
- **Locations** = “Where do you spend most of your day at school?”
